# Corona-19
1) Python Code for Probability prediction for corona disease for patient.  

2) This Machine learning model based on randam data set of BASIC SYMPTOMS like Fever, 	Dry cough,	Difficulty in breathing, RunnyNose,	Tiredness,	Body Aches,	Sore throat,	Bluish lips or face,	Persistent pain or pressure in the chest and Age.

3)Change the data set and index accordingly and train the model you will get predicted probability.

#How to run

-Make sure You have installed all depedencies required for script.

-For getting Well Sorted results use SPYDER IDLE.

-Run script unitwise. 

-confusion matrix will return a 2x2 matrix. where,addition A11 + A22 represents correct predictions and addition of A12+A21 represents mismatched values of predictions and real values . 


In this model Logistic regression has used Because our result is in the format of (yes or no) 0 or 1 which means it returns bullean value.
